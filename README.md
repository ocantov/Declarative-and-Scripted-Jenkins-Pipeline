# Declarative Jenkins Pipeline with a scripted part
This is an example for learning purposes, is a simple Declarative Pipeline with parallel steps that also has a scripted part. It does nothing useful, just run stages as examples with some sh commands and progress bar.

It uses kubernetes pod as Jenkins agent, so you need a Kubernetes plugin configured in Jenkins in order to run it successfully
